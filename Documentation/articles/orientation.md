# Grid Orientation

This describes the orientations of the various grids in cARcassonne.

## Visual Game Board

***NB: The game's visual grid (and tiles) should be replaced with Unity's built-in system as in https://github.com/Egocentric-Interaction-Research-Group/cARcassonne/issues/8***

Floating point coordinate system has origin at bottom left. Right is x-positive. Up is y-positive.

## Board Tile Matrix

In the board matrix, (0,0) is at the bottom left. Right is x-positive. Up is y-positive.

Centre is 85, 85.

Each tile takes up a space, so the limits after the first tile at (85, 85) - (86, 86)
